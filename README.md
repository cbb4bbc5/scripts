# My personal programs #

## Introduction ##
This repository is part of my goal to have my various files easily available for
distribution on different unix-like operating systems. It contains selected
files from `$HOME/.local/bin`.

## Usage ##
Be sure to have `$HOME/.local/bin` added to your `PATH` variable. Consider also
setting environmental variables mentioned in the scripts.
